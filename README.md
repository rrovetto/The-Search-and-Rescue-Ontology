# The Search and Rescue Ontology (SARO or SAR-O)
An domain reference ontology modeling generic concepts, data, knowledge, objects, activities, and methods in search and rescue.

## Description
As a domain reference ontology, SAR-O offers a conceptual model of a particular universe of discourse (a domain), assumed to have approximate if fuzzy boundaries. Given the composing generic domain-specific cooncepts, it serves as a reference model for the target discipline, industry, or domain.

SAR-O is intended to capture generic concepts, and provide corresponding vocabulary for more specialized SAR ontology modules: maritime, ground, etc. An ontology modeule for each type of SAR can be made, and can use the more generic concepts in SAR-O. For example, the Maritime SAR Ontology is a more domain-specific ontology for water search and rescue, whose ontology constructs can be linked to the more generic ones of SAR-O. SAR-O can be composed of various such modules to form a universal ontological model of SAR.

SAR-O asserts basic categories for: SAR equipment, personnel, activities, procedures/protocols, missions, and data. These categories are asserted as:

SAR_equipment
SAR_personnel
SAR_role
SAR_activity
SAR_data
